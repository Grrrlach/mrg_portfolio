            <text-align:top>With 15 years of program and project management in private sector, government, and non-profit work, I'm becoming a programmer so I'll have the 
                groundwork to turn my skills toward a new field.</text-align:top>

            I've lived in Portland, Chicago, Southern Vermont, but home is Western New York, between Buffalo and Niagara Falls, in a pretty rural area. So 
            rural that abandoned kittens show up on my doorstep from time to time. I've had Wendy the longest.<br><br>

            A few other things:
            <ul>
                <li>I've hosted outdoor movies throughout the pandemic - even setting up a drive-in theater in the winter. The best films seem to be at least 40 years old.</li>
                <li>My college campus had peacocks on it.</li>
                <li>I once ran into a burning building in an attempt to rescue a woman who, as it turned out, wasn't home.</li>
            </ul>
